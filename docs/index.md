# What is b2fJ?

Back to the Future Java (b2fJ) is a Java Virtual Machine intended to run on the 8-bit home computers of the 80s.

It can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/mzattera/b2fJ/releases/latest).

It is based on the [leJOS](http://www.lejos.org) JVM for the LEGO Mindstorms RCX brick.

In this current state, it is basically a straight port of leJOS RCX to the popular Commodore 64. As such, it has all features of leJOS:

* Lets you develop using Java (fully-featured OO language)
* Preemptive threads with synchronization
* Multi-dimensional arrays
* Exceptions
* Float, long, String types (custom implementation)

â€¦and all of its limitations, most noticeably it lacks garbage collection.

In addition, being a straight port, b2fJ is basically an interpreted machine with a 32-bit architecture running on top of a 30 year old 8-bit machine with limited RAM. This to say that much can (and hopefully will) be done to improve b2fJ speed and memory footprint. However, the current implementation shows that running Java on an 8-bit machine is possible.

## Small demo

Below a small demo showing b2fJ at work inside the [VICE emulator](http://vice-emu.sourceforge.net/). This shows how multi-thread programming can be use to move C64 sprites.

The Java source for the demo, can be downloaded from [here](./Sprite.java). See below for instructions about how to compile and run it.

# Installation and Set Up

## JDK

In order to compile and run your Java programs, you need first of all to have a [Java Development Kit](https://www.google.ch/search?q=JDK+1.7+download) installed. I am using version 1.7.0 but any version from 1.5 up should work.

Make sure that the JDK folder is in your path or that you have set [JAVA_HOME](https://www.google.ch/search?q=set+JAVA_HOME+Windows) properly.

## b2fJ

Download and unzip [latest b2fJ distribution](https://github.com/mzattera/b2fJ/releases/latest). It's easier to work if you add the "bin" folder in the distribution to your [PATH variable](https://www.google.ch/search?q=set+PATH+windows); the below instructions assume you did so. If not, you obviously must specify the full path for each command in the different compilation steps.

# Compile and run Java Programs

The below steps explain how to compile and run a simple Java program on your C64.


For our example, we will use a simple HelloWorld.java file. You can paste the code below into a file named HelloWorld.java, or create the file with your favorite Java editor.

	public class HelloWorld {

		public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
			while (true) {            
				System.out.print("Hello World! ");
				Thread.sleep(500);
			}
		}
	}


## The easy way

Unfortunately, in order to overcome the limitations of our target platform, several additional steps are required compared to standard Java development when compiling our Java programs.

The good news is that you can forget all of the details and just invoke the below command to compile your Java program and run it inside the [VICE emulator](http://vice-emu.sourceforge.net/) provided with b2fJ:

    b2fJGO HelloWorld.java

It will take some time to load, be patient ;-)

## The boring details

Below, you can find a step-by-step explanation of the build process, which also sheds some light over the development toolchain.
    
### From .java to .class

The below command will compile HelloWorld.java into corresponding `.class` file. 

    b2fJc HelloWorld.java
    
It will simply invoke the JDK compiler and compile your classes using the b2fJ libraries, instead of using the standard ones.

Notice that:
    
* more than one .java file can be passed for compilation
* you can provide a class-path to your classes and libraries by setting CLASSPATH variable properly.

### From `.class` to C

This step squeezes all `.class` files into a binary format compact enough to be loaded in the b2fJ virtual machine.

Starting from the class that contains the `main()` method, all methods invoked by the program are retrieved and corresponding java bytecode is added into the resulting `.o` file.

This produces a binary that can be thought as a tiny `.jar` that contains the minimal code required to run your program and that can be executed by the JVM.

However, in order to make the JVM even more compact, we translate the `.o` file into a C header that is then compiled directly into (or together with) the JVM. The JVM will then be a single C64 executable containing both the actual Java interpreter and your java code.

The below command transforms the .class file into a C header (`java_code.h`) which is then moved into folder "src\platform\c64" where the JVM source code resides, for later compilation.

### Building the JVM

Finally, we must re-build the b2fJ Virtual Machine that, as explained above, will embed your program which will be executed when the JVM is launched.

The below command is a batch file that uses cc65, a 6502 cross-assembler (re)distributed with b2fJ, to compile the JVM for the C64.

    buildJVM
    
Do not be scared by the many "Warnings" you will see printed; the build will only stop on errors (that will be displayed).

If the process is successful, a file called "b2fJ.prg" should have been created; this is your JVM.

### Running the program

At last! You can now run your Java program on your C64.

If you don't have a C64 at hand (and if you do, please send me a video of your Java running on it) you can use the WinVICE emulator that is (re)distributed with b2fJ, under "redistr\WinVICE-3.1-x86"; you can launch "x64.exe" then under "File > Autostart Disk/Tape image" choose the "b2fJ.prg" file you created above.
