b2fJ is based on the leJOS RCX project (http://www.lejos.org/) which is also distributed under MPL 1.0.
At present, btfJ shares most of its code with leJOX RCX JVM, its standard class library and jtool library, being mainly a port of leJOS under 8-bit architectures (most notably the Commodore 64).

leJOS is a tiny Java Virtual Machine targeting different Lego Mindstorms (RCX, NXJ & EV3); the project has many contributors, among them, Brian Bagnall, Jürgen Stuber and Paul Andrews.

leJOS was originally based on TinyVM by Jose H. Solorzano (http://tinyvm.sourceforge.net/).
